"""
Pathway Enrichment Analysis for Personal Genomic Variants

Analyzes which biological pathways are overrepresented among personal
genetic variants in the genome vault. Uses manual KEGG/Reactome pathway
mappings based on known gene-pathway associations.

IMPORTANT CAVEAT: This is NOT a proper GWAS enrichment analysis. The gene
panel is heavily biased toward clinically actionable genes (CYP450, immune,
neurotransmitter). Enrichment reflects ascertainment bias as much as biology.

  1. ASCERTAINMENT BIAS: Genes were selected for clinical/PGx relevance,
     not randomly sampled. Drug metabolism and neurotransmitter pathways
     are overrepresented by design, not because of unusual genetic load.

  2. SMALL N: With ~109 genes, statistical power is still low. The
     hypergeometric test is underpowered and most p-values will not
     survive multiple testing correction.

  3. MANUAL MAPPING: Pathway assignments are curated, not from a formal
     gene ontology database query. Some secondary pathway memberships
     may be missing.

  4. VARIANT CLASSIFICATION: 'Non-reference' includes heterozygous states
     that may have minimal functional impact. The binary variant/no-variant
     classification loses effect-size information.

  5. NOT A GWAS: This analysis cannot identify novel biology. It can only
     confirm that the existing panel is enriched where expected, and flag
     potential coverage gaps.
