"""
Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) Analysis for Personal Genomics Vault

Identifies which variants in the vault are likely in LD (tagging the same signal)
vs. genuinely independent. Uses physical distance on the same chromosome plus
published LD data from 1000 Genomes EUR population where available.

Without population-level haplotype data, this analysis flags POTENTIAL LD based on:
1. Same chromosome + within 500kb = potential LD
2. Known high-LD regions (FADS cluster chr11, CYP2C cluster chr10, HLA chr6)
3. Published r² values from 1000 Genomes EUR where available
4. Same-SNP identification (DRD2/ANKK1 rs1800497)

Output: text report to stdout; can be redirected to file.
